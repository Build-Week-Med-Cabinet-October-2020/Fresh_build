# Med Cabinet

This project was a collaboration between students in the third and fourth units of the Lambda School Data Science program. The students in the third unit were responsible for the functionality of the web application located here: https://medcabinetproject.herokuapp.com/ while the students in the fourth unit were responsible for creating the underlying models that provide the recommendations. The application itself is very easy to use, simply select your desired type of cannabis, the effects you are seeking from the strain, the ailments you are wanting to treat, and your preferred flavors and our model will provide three recommendations based on similarity of your input to strains found in our dataset.

The dataset we used can be found here: https://github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset/blob/master/Dataset/Strains/strains-kushy_api.2017-11-14.csv
